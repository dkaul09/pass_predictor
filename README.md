#  Pass Predictor Project ⚽

Hey guys! 👋  
**
My name is Dhruv Kaul, and I am a junior at the University of Southern California (USC) with a deep interest in machine learning and football (soccer - I like to call it football though haha). 

I pursued this project as an opportunity to combine my passion for both fields while diving into the world of **sports analytics**.  

This project is being built with the intention of me:  
- 🎯 Learning how to work with **StatsBomb Open Data**.  
- 📚 Developing my **machine learning skills**.  
- 🛠️ Working with libraries such as **PyTorch**, **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.  

I hope that my journey can also help and inform people about the exciting intersections of machine learning, data analysis, and the beautiful game. 🌍⚽

### **25/11:**  
🚀 *Day 1 of the Pass Predictor Project!*  

Today is the first day I’m working on this project. I want to start off slow, especially since this is my first time working with StatsBomb data. It’s 1:49 AM, and I’m sitting in Indira Gandhi Airport . Honestly, I couldn’t think of a better time to start than now—before heading back to USC to face the chaos of homework and, of course, jet lag.  

Despite the busy semester, this project is something I’ve wanted to work on for a while, and starting this blog feels like the perfect way to keep myself accountable and truly chase my passions and goals. Combining my love for football and machine learning into a single project has been a dream of mine, and I’m excited to actually get started on it.  

Today, I decided to focus on the basics: exploring the pass parameters. I’m starting with just a few key parameters, keeping it simple with the intention of scaling it later to include more advanced features. Eventually, I hope to transform this into a usable app—but for now, it’s all about taking the first step.  

### ⚙️ Parameters I’m Starting With:
- **Pass Length**: The distance covered by the pass.  
- **Pass Angle**: The direction of the pass relative to the passer’s position.  
- **Pass Outcome**: Whether the pass was successful or not.  
- **Location**: The starting coordinates of the pass.  
- **Player Pressure**: Whether the passer was under defensive pressure.  
- **Pitch Zone**: The area of the pitch where the pass originates.  
- **Passer Position**: The role of the player making the pass (e.g., defender, midfielder, forward).

### **26/11:**  
Today, I decided to focus on extracting the data. At the moment, I am using the information about all the passes from the 2022 FIFA World Cup only and got about 67,000 data points. Currently, I am aiming to make a simple model, so I will later on take into account the positioning of all players on the pitch when I will make a more advanced model later down the line. 

Next, I will focus on exploring different methods to make a machine learning model and see which has the highest accuracy rate in predicting whether the passes will happen and share my results and insights.
